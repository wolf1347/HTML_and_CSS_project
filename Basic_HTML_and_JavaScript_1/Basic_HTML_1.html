	Green is the best color. 
	This one is called <b>"sea green"</b> and is very pretty. This font was written 
	by using the color name instead of the color code. This is probably the color I 
	would pick since it is more legible. The size of this one was also changed to
	<i> font size 10</i> and written in the <u>Ariel Black</u> font. It is a bit boring 
	but is <b>"Web Safe"</b>

			<font color="#00FA9A" face="Impact" size="14">This one may be hard to read but 
	it is my favorite shade of green. It is <b>#00FA9A</b> aka <b>mediumspringgreen</b>	and was 
	written using the color code instead of the name. Even though it is my favorite I typically
	would not pick this one as it isn't legible. It has been changed to have the <u>"impact"</u> 
	font and a bigger <i>size "12"</i> font size to make it easier to read. This is also a bit 
	boring but <b>"Web Safe"</b>
